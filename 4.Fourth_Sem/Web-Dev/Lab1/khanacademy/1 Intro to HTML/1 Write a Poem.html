    <h1>I'am not..</h1>
    <p>
        I'm not selfish, I just know how to live for myself. <br>
I'm not arrogant, I just don't think it's necessary to smile at everyone. <br>
I'm not cocky, I just don't reach into my pocket for a word. <br>
I'm not jealous, I'm just used to being the only one. <br>
I'm not offended, I'm just changing my mind about people.
